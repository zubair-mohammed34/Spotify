# Spotify Projrct

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries to solve business problems and generating insights.

```sql
-- Create Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
### Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

## Business Problems ##
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed` = TRUE.
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
6. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
7. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
8. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
9. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
10. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
11. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
12. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
13. Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
14. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
15. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
